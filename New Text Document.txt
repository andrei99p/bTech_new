Project structure:
index.html
styles.css
scripts.js

Page layout:

navbar at the top:
	logo svg or png on the left
	4 buttons for sections on the right

1st section has a container in the center, close to the top of the page.
The container resembles frosted glass and allows the background image to be seen through the frost glass.

The 2nd section has another container in the middle, centered with the same design

The 3rd section has yet another container centered, close to the bottom.

The 4th section has a contact form that sits in the middle.

At the bottom of the page is a small black section in which I will add other information.
